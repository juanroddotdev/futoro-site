# SimpleLoader Integration Checklist

## Required Dependencies

- [ ] **Vue.js** - Ensure Vue.js is installed in the main branch
- [ ] **GSAP** - Install GSAP if not already installed:
  ```bash
  npm install gsap
  ```
- [ ] **Vara.js** - Install Vara.js if not already installed:
  ```bash
  npm install vara
  ```
- [ ] **Google Fonts** - Ensure the Raleway font is loaded in the main branch

## CSS Variables

Ensure the following CSS variables are defined in the main branch:

- [ ] `--theme-primary` - Primary theme color (default: #88C0D0)
- [ ] `--theme-secondary` - Secondary theme color (default: #5E81AC)
- [ ] `--theme-text-primary` - Primary text color (default: #E5E9F0)

## Integration Steps

1. [ ] Copy the entire `simple-loader` folder to the `src/components` directory in the main branch
2. [ ] Import the component in your app:
   ```js
   import { SimpleLoader } from '@/components/simple-loader';
   ```
3. [ ] Register the component:
   ```js
   app.component('SimpleLoader', SimpleLoader);
   ```
4. [ ] Use the component in your template:
   ```html
   <SimpleLoader 
     :headline="'Your Headline'" 
     :subheadline="'Your Subheadline'"
     :showDebug="false"
     @complete="onLoaderComplete"
   />
   ```

## Potential Issues and Solutions

1. [ ] **Import Paths**: If you encounter import path issues, check that all imports in the SimpleLoader component and its utilities are using relative paths (e.g., `./utils/spotlightReveal` instead of `@/components/ui/loaders/utils/spotlightReveal`)

2. [ ] **CSS Variables**: If the component doesn't look right, check that the CSS variables are defined in the main branch. You can add them to your global CSS file:
   ```css
   :root {
     --theme-primary: #88C0D0;
     --theme-secondary: #5E81AC;
     --theme-text-primary: #E5E9F0;
   }
   ```

3. [ ] **Vara.js Integration**: If the Vara.js animations don't work, check that the Vara.js library is properly loaded and that the `useVara` composable is correctly implemented.

4. [ ] **GSAP Animations**: If the GSAP animations don't work, check that GSAP is properly installed and imported.

5. [ ] **Font Loading**: If the Raleway font doesn't load, ensure that the Google Fonts link is included in your HTML:
   ```html
   <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Raleway:wght@400;700;900&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
   ```

## Testing

1. [ ] Test the component in isolation using the provided example.vue file
2. [ ] Test the component in the context of your application
3. [ ] Test the component with different props to ensure it behaves as expected
4. [ ] Test the component on different devices and browsers to ensure compatibility

## Performance Considerations

1. [ ] Monitor the performance of the component, especially on mobile devices
2. [ ] Consider adding a `pauseAnimations` prop to disable animations on low-end devices
3. [ ] Consider adding a `showDebug` prop to help debug issues in production

## Accessibility Considerations

1. [ ] Ensure the component is accessible to screen readers
2. [ ] Consider adding ARIA attributes to improve accessibility
3. [ ] Test the component with a screen reader to ensure it's usable
