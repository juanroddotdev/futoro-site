# Eraser Effect Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Create the Eraser Effect
- **Add a Mask Layer:**
  - Add a mask or clip-path to the SVG container that will act as our eraser
  - This could be a simple rectangle that moves across the container
- **Animate the Mask:**
  - Use GSAP to animate the mask from right to left, gradually hiding the current content
  - Start with a simple animation to ensure the basic effect works
- **Test and Refine:**
  - Make sure the eraser effect looks smooth and works as expected
  - Adjust the timing and easing to get the right feel

## Phase 2: Prepare the New Container
- **Create the Target Container:**
  - Design the SVG container that will match the layout in HeroSectionNoChat.vue
  - Position it where the final content should appear
- **Set Up Initial State:**
  - Make the new container initially invisible or transparent
  - Ensure it's positioned correctly relative to the eraser animation

## Phase 3: Coordinate the Transition
- **Link the Animations:**
  - Coordinate the eraser animation with the appearance of the new container
  - The new container should start to appear as the eraser moves across the screen
- **Add Drawing Effect:**
  - Implement a drawing animation for the new container
  - This could be a simple path animation that draws the container outline

## Phase 4: Refine and Polish
- **Add Text Transition:**
  - Fade out the text as it's being erased
  - Fade in the new text at the appropriate position
- **Add Visual Details:**
  - Add pencil-like effects to the eraser and drawing animations
  - Ensure the animations match the existing style
- **Test Across Devices:**
  - Make sure the animation works well on different screen sizes
  - Adjust timing and positioning as needed

## Getting Started
To begin with Phase 1, we should:
1. Examine the current SVG container structure in the hero loader
2. Add a mask element to the SVG
3. Create a simple GSAP animation to move the mask
